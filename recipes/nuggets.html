    <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Nuggets</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts and/or thighs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fine dry breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/3 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sliced green onions</li>
        <li>3 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sauce</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Sriracha hot sauce, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground Sichuan pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <strong>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
    </strong>
    <p>Cut chicken into about 1 to 1 1/2- inch pieces; add to the bowl of a food processor. Add breadcrumbs, salt,
        paprika, black pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, and the 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the food processor, and
        pulse on and off until mixture is finely ground, but not yet a smooth puree.</p>

    <strong>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
    </strong>
    <p>
        Scoop 2 tablespoon-sized portions onto a sheet pan, making 24 total. Cover and chill for about 30 minutes.
        Meanwhile, shake self-rising flour and cornstarch together in a bag, and set aside (if using all-purpose flour,
        add
        in 1/2 teaspoon baking soda).
    </p>

    <strong>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
    </strong>
    <p>Using slightly damp hands, shape each portion into a ball; add 5 to 6 at a time to the flour mixture in the bag.
        Toss to coat, shake off excess, and place back on the sheet pan. Once coated, form each into the nugget shape of
        your choice. A ball shape works well for deep frying; if pan-frying, a flat nugget works best.</p>

    <strong>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
    </strong>
    <p>Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 to 2 hours, or until ready to fry. Nuggets can be made a day ahead.</p>

    <strong>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
    </strong>
    <p>While nuggets chill, whisk mayonnaise, honey, Sriracha, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and Sichuan pepper
        together in a bowl; cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.</p>

    <strong>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
    </strong>
    <p>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Deep fry nuggets until no
        longerpink
        at the center and golden brown on the outside, about 4 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted near the
        center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Alternately, heat oil as needed in a skillet over medium-high
        heat,
        and shallow fry until cooked as above, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
    </p>

    <strong>
        <h4>Step 7</h4>
    </strong>
    <p>
        Transfer cooked nuggets to a mixing bowl, and add half the sliced green onions. Pour in about 1/2 cup sauce, and
        toss to coat. Extra sauce can be served alongside, or used for other applicationsâ€”as sandwich spread or as a
        dip.
    </p>

    <strong>
        <h4>Step 8</h4>
    </strong>
    <p>Transfer to a serving platter, top with more Sriracha and remaining green onions. Serve immediately.</p>
